structurework
=============

Repository for programs and Python scripts for molecular structure analysis.

See the sub-folders in this repository for specifics. (Sorely need to improve on this.)


Related 'Binderized' Utilities
----------------------------

Collection of links to launchable Jupyter environment where various structure/function analysis tools work. Many of my recent scripts are built with use in these environments in mind:

- [bio3d-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/bio3d-binder) - launchable, working Jupyter-baseed environment with the Bio3D package for Macromolecular Structure Analysis running in R+Jupyter (RStudio is an option there, too) with some examples (*R-based*).

- [cl_demo-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/cl_demo-binder) - launchable, working Jupyter-baseed environment that has a collection of demonstrations useful resources on command line for manipulating structure files
